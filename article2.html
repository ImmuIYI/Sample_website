        <h1 class="font1">About instagram</h1>
        <p class="font2">Instagram is an American photo and video sharing social networking service founded in 2010 by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger,
            and later acquired by American company Facebook Inc.,
            now known as Meta Platforms. The app allows users to upload media that can be edited with filters and organized 
            by hashtags and geographical tagging. Posts can be shared publicly or with preapproved followers.
            Users can browse other users' content by tag and location, view trending content, like photos, and follow other users to add their content to a personal feed.
            Instagram was originally distinguished by allowing content to be framed only in a square (1:1) 
            aspect ratio of 640 pixels to match the display width of the iPhone at the time. In 2015, this restriction was eased with an increase to 1080 pixels.
            It also added messaging features, the ability to include multiple images or videos in a single post,
            and a Stories feature—similar to its main competitor Snapchat—which allowed users to post 
            their content to a sequential feed, with each post accessible to others for 24 hours. As of January 2019, Stories is used by 500 million people daily.</p>
